I‚Äôm an experienced data scientist passionate about solving problems with data.

For over five years, I‚Äôve worked on projects that turn raw data into insights‚Äîbuilding predictive models, designing data pipelines, and analyzing trends to help businesses make smarter decisions. My work focuses on simplifying complex problems with tools like Python, SQL, and machine learning, making data useful and impactful.

I also enjoy teaching and mentoring in data science. Helping others understand data and apply it effectively is one of my favorite parts of the job.

üñ•Ô∏è **Personal Projects**:

I have an [occasional podcast](https://podcast.tdhopper.com) in which I talk to friends about things they're interested in. You can find it in your podcast directory or at [podcast.tdhopper.com](https://podcast.tdhopper.com).

Years ago, I created [Should I Get a Phd?](https://tdhopper.com/phd) where I interviewed nine friends about whether a young, bright student should consider pursuing a PhD. This is the resource I wish I'd had before starting a PhD program, and it's been useful to many.

[Python Plotting for Exploratory Data Analysis](https://pythonplot.com) is a Rosetta Stone for Python plotting libraries, and it also compares them to the GOAT of plotting libraries: ggplot.

I created [Notes on Dirichlet Processes](https://dp.tdhopper.com) after working on a [DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil)-funded open source project for developing [Bayesian nonparametric models in Python](http://datamicroscopes.github.io). I did a lot of work to understand Bayesian nonparametrics and derive the Gibbs sampler for Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes. [Notes on Dirichlet Processes](https://dp.tdhopper.com) shares what I learned for the benefit of others.

I enjoy wildlife and nature photography in my free time. [dothopper photo](https://photos.tdhopper.com) is my gallery.

[Free Disk Space](https://freespace.tdhopper.com) is a little site I maintain with commands for freeing up disk space on your computer.
