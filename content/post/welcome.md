I’m an experienced data scientist passionate about solving problems with data.

For over five years, I’ve worked on projects that turn raw data into insights—building predictive models, designing data pipelines, and analyzing trends to help businesses make smarter decisions. My work focuses on simplifying complex problems with tools like Python, SQL, and machine learning, making data useful and impactful.

I also enjoy teaching and mentoring in data science. Helping others understand data and apply it effectively is one of my favorite parts of the job.
